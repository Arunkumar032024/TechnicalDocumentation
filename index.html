            <h2>Hypertext Markup Language</h2>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and layout of a web page by using a system of tags and attributes to define various elements such as text, images, links, forms, and multimedia content.<br>Here's a breakdown of some key components and concepts in HTML:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Tags: </b>HTML documents are made up of HTML tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets `< >`. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with content between them.</li>
                <li><b>Attributes: </b>HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag and typically consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign.</li>
                <li><b>Elements: </b>An HTML element consists of the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag, all of which together define a specific part of a web page.</li>
                <li><b>Document Structure: </b>HTML documents have a hierarchical structure defined by various elements such as < html >, `< head >`, and `< body >`. The `< html >` element is the root element and contains all other elements, while the `< head >` element contains meta-information about the document (such as the title and metadata), and the `< body >` element contains the content of the document.</li>
                <li><b>Semantic Markup: </b>HTML offers a range of elements that provide semantic meaning to content, making it more understandable to both humans and machines. For example, `< header >`, `< nav >`, `< article >`, `< footer >`, and `< section >` are semantic elements that describe the different parts of a web page's content.</li>
                <li><b>Links and URLs: </b>HTML allows you to create hyperlinks using the `< a >` element, which stands for anchor. Links are defined using the `href` attribute, which specifies the URL of the linked resource.</li>
                <li><b>Forms: </b>HTML provides elements like `< form >`, `< input >`, `< button >`, and others for creating interactive forms on web pages. Forms allow users to input data and submit it to a server for processing.</li>    
                <li><b>Multimedia: </b>HTML supports embedding multimedia content such as images, audio, and video using elements like `< img >`, `< audio >`, and `< video >`.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>HTML is often used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to create dynamic and visually appealing web pages.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="css">
            <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects like SVG or XHTML). It enables web designers to control the layout, formatting, and appearance of multiple web pages all at once.<br>Here are the key aspects of CSS:</p>           
            <ol>
                <li><b>Selectors: </b>CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements that you want to style. Selectors can target elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or even their position in the document tree.</li>
                <li><b>Properties and Values: </b>CSS declarations consist of one or more property-value pairs. A property is the aspect of the element you want to change (e.g., color, font-size, margin), and the value is the setting for that property (e.g., blue, 16px, 20px auto). Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons, and each declaration block is enclosed in curly braces.</li>
                <li><b>Cascade: </b>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets because it allows for the "cascading" of styles. This means that multiple style sheets can be applied to the same document, and the styles will cascade or flow together. Conflicting styles are resolved based on specificity (how specific a selector is) and source order (the order in which style rules are declared).</li>
                <li><b>Inheritance: </b>CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to their children. This means that if a property is applied to a parent element, its children will inherit that property unless explicitly overridden. Not all properties are inherited; some are considered non-inherited by default.</li>
                <li><b>Units: </b>CSS supports various units for specifying lengths, such as pixels (px), ems (em), rems (rem), percentages (%), viewport width (vw), and viewport height (vh), among others. These units allow for flexible and responsive design.</li>
                <li><b>Media Queries: </b>CSS allows for responsive design by using media queries. Media queries apply different styles based on characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width, height, orientation, and resolution. This enables developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, such as those of desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
                <li><b>External, Internal, and Inline Styles: </b>CSS can be applied to HTML documents in three ways: externally, internally, or inline. External stylesheets are separate files linked to HTML documents using the `< link >` element. Internal styles are defined within the HTML document's `style` element in the `< head >` section. Inline styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By using CSS, web designers can achieve consistent and visually appealing designs across different web pages and devices, separating the presentation from the structure and content of the document.</p>

        <section id="js">
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and behavior to web pages. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern web browsers.<br>Here are some key aspects of JavaScript:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Client-side Scripting: </b>JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs in the user's web browser rather than on the web server. This allows for dynamic interactions and updates on the web page without requiring a page reload.</li>
                <li><b>Event-Driven Programming: </b>JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it responds to user actions or events such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, page loads, and form submissions. Developers can define functions (event handlers) to execute in response to these events.</li>
                <li><b>DOM Manipulation: </b>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. JavaScript enables developers to access and manipulate the DOM, allowing them to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page in response to user actions or other events.</li>
                <li><b>Data Types and Variables: </b>JavaScript supports various data types including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Variables are used to store and manipulate data, and they can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.</li>
                <li><b>Functions and Scope: </b>Functions are blocks of reusable code that can be called to perform a specific task. JavaScript supports both named and anonymous functions. Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within a program. JavaScript has function scope, meaning variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function, unless declared with `var` in which case they have function scope or with `let` or `const` in which case they have block scope.</li>
                <li><b>Control Flow: </b>JavaScript supports various control flow statements such as `if...else`, `switch`, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do...while` loops. These statements allow developers to control the flow of execution within their programs based on certain conditions.</li>
                <li><b>Asynchronous Programming: </b>JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the main execution thread. This is achieved using asynchronous functions, callbacks, promises, and more recently, async/await syntax.</li>
                <li><b>Error Handling: </b>JavaScript provides mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution. Developers can use `try...catch` blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.</li>
                <li><b>Modules and Packages: </b>JavaScript supports modular programming through the use of modules. Modules encapsulate code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse. With the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript also supports built-in modules, allowing developers to organize code into reusable units.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language that is not only used for web development but also for server-side development (with Node.js), desktop application development (with Electron), mobile app development (with frameworks like React Native), game development, and more. Its widespread adoption and rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks make it a popular choice for building a wide range of applications.</p>

            <h2>Git</h2>
            <p>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to manage software development projects efficiently and collaboratively. It allows developers to track changes to their codebase, collaborate with teammates, and manage different versions of their project files. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world.<br>Here are some key concepts and features of Git:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Repository: </b>A Git repository, or repo, is a collection of files and directories associated with a project, along with metadata related to the project's history and versioning. Git repositories can be local (stored on a developer's machine) or remote (stored on a server or online platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).</li>
                <li><b>Version Control: </b>Git tracks changes to files within a repository over time, allowing developers to view the history of changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others without fear of losing work. Each change is recorded as a commit, which includes a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash), a commit message describing the change, and a pointer to the previous commit.</li>
                <li><b>Branching and Merging: </b>Git uses branches to isolate changes and experimental features from the main codebase. Developers can create new branches to work on specific tasks or features independently, without affecting the main codebase. Once a feature is complete, changes from the feature branch can be merged back into the main branch using Git's merge functionality.</li>
                <li><b>Collaboration: </b>Git enables collaboration among developers by allowing them to share and synchronize changes to a shared repository. Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, each in their own branch, and merge their changes together when ready. Git also supports workflows like pull requests, where developers propose changes to the main codebase and request feedback and approval from teammates.</li>
                <li><b>Distributed: </b>Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history, on their local machine.

            <h2>React</h2>
            <p>React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page web applications. It is one of the most popular libraries for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces, and it's known for its component-based architecture and declarative programming approach.<br>Key features of React include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Component-Based Architecture: </b>React follows a component-based architecture, where the user interface is broken down into reusable and composable components. Components encapsulate both the structure (HTML-like markup) and behavior (JavaScript logic) of a UI element, making it easier to manage and maintain complex user interfaces.</li>
                <li><b>Declarative Syntax: </b>React uses a declarative programming paradigm, where developers describe what they want their UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the UI to match the desired state. This is in contrast to imperative programming, where developers have to manually manipulate the DOM to update the UI.</li>
                <li><b>Virtual DOM: </b>React utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), a lightweight copy of the actual DOM, to optimize UI updates. When the state of a component changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous version and efficiently updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This helps improve performance and minimize re-renders, leading to faster and smoother user experiences.</li>
                <li><b>JSX: </b>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files. JSX is used to define the structure of React components, making it easier to visualize and understand the component's UI. JSX code is compiled by tools like Babel into regular JavaScript code that React can understand.</li>
                <li><b>Unidirectional Data Flow: </b>React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows only in one direction—from parent components to child components. This helps maintain a clear and predictable data flow within the application, making it easier to understand and debug.</li>
                <li><b>Component Lifecycle: </b>React components have a lifecycle consisting of various methods that are called at different stages of a component's existence, such as when it is mounted, updated, or unmounted. Developers can define custom logic within these lifecycle methods to perform tasks like fetching data, setting up event listeners, and cleaning up resources.</li>
                <li><b>Hooks: </b>React introduced Hooks in React 16.8 as a way to add state and lifecycle features to functional components. Hooks allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class component, making it easier to manage stateful logic in functional components.</li>
                <li><b>React Router: </b>React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It allows developers to define routes and navigation within their single-page applications, enabling users to navigate between different views or pages without causing a full page refresh.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, React provides developers with a powerful and efficient way to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces for web applications. Its component-based architecture, declarative syntax, virtual DOM, and other features make it a popular choice for building modern web applications with a focus on user experience and developer productivity.</p>
